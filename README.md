This project is learning how to nodejs work and how to init a project with NodeJS & ExpressJS 

I'm learning the basic router in ExpressJS, MVC model flow and request by client and response by back end.

Also, I'm learning basic CRUD, using handlebars-express (which is a template engine in Express) for the front-end

In the future, I'll learn how to create APIs and security on the back-end. Maybe JWT
